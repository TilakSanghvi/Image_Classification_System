# Image Classification System

## Overview
This project implements an image classification system with a graphical user interface (GUI). It leverages machine learning techniques to classify images into predefined categories, providing a user-friendly interface for interaction.

## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks and Libraries**:
  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Tkinter (for GUI)
  - OpenCV
- **Tools**:
  - Jupyter Notebook

## Features
- **GUI Integration**: Provides a user-friendly interface for image classification.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes pre-trained models for accurate image classification.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Allows users to load images and get real-time classification results.
- **Data Processing**: Includes preprocessing steps to handle image data efficiently.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/TilakSanghvi/Image_Classification_System.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
